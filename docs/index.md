The Collaborative Crop Resilience Program (CCRP) is a research program focused on understanding the complex interactions between wheat (Triticum aestivum) and bacteria, fungi, and viruses. By studying the plant microbiome, the CCRP aims to identify ways to enhance plant resilience through the manipulation of the microbiome, and to gain a deeper understanding of how these interactions affect plant growth, development, and health. This research has the potential to inform the development of new crop varieties, breeding techniques, and sustainable farming practices that can help farmers and other stakeholders adapt to and mitigate the impacts of environmental stressors such as drought, heat, and pests.

## Data management
The Collaborative Crop Resilience Project (CCRP) aims to facilitate data sharing and promote best practices in data management among its sister projects. To achieve this goal, we have established a framework for storing and sharing data among the platforms ERDA, Github, and Biolomics.

Raw data, processed data, and results generated by CCRP projects should be stored on ERDA. Scripts used for processing the data and generating results should be stored on Github. Metadata and other data that can be stored in the appropriate format should be stored on Biolomics. It is important that all associated data is traceable between the repositories, meaning that metadata on Biolomics should link to data stored on ERDA and Github, and vice versa.

This repository provides information on how to navigate the CCRP data structure on ERDA and how to transfer data between ERDA, Computerome, and other computers. The available pages are listed on the left. For more information on the CCRP, please visit the Collaborative Crop Resilience Project homepage.





As part of our commitment to transparency and openness, the CCRP adheres to the FAIR principles when it comes to data management. This means that our data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We believe that by following these principles, we can improve the discoverability and usability of our data, and support the broader scientific community in using our data to advance research and innovation. By making our data open and easily accessible, we hope to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and the public good.
