The Collaborative Crop Resilience Project (CCRP) aims to facilitate data sharing and promote best practices in data management among its sister projects. To achieve this goal, we have established a framework for storing and sharing data among the platforms ERDA, Github, and Biolomics.

Raw data, processed data, and results generated by CCRP projects should be stored on ERDA. Scripts used for processing the data and generating results should be stored on Github. Metadata and other data that can be stored in the appropriate format should be stored on Biolomics. It is important that all associated data is traceable between the repositories, meaning that metadata on Biolomics should link to data stored on ERDA and Github, and vice versa.

This repository provides information on how to navigate the CCRP data structure on ERDA and how to transfer data between ERDA, Computerome, and other computers. The available pages are listed on the left. For more information on the CCRP, please visit the Collaborative Crop Resilience Project homepage.
