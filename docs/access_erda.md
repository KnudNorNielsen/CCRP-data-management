# How to get started with ERDA

### Univeristy of Copenhagen (UCPH) affiliates
ERDA is a data archive set up by the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). All students and employees at UCPH can log in to ERDA and request access to any workgroup. Once you have done this, please contact one of the responsible persons to ensure that your request is not overlooked for too long.

### Non-UCPH collaborators
If you are a non-UCPH collaborator who needs access to one of the CCRP domains on ERDA, you must first obtain clearance from a workgroup owner listed below. This involves a sign-up procedure where the workgroup owner vouches for you by informing the central command (i.e., Knud Nor Nielsen) which workgroup you should have access to and for how long. Once the central command accepts the request sent through the ERDA sign-up procedure (outlined below), you will receive an automatic notification. The final steps are for you to sign in to ERDA to activate your account and for the workgroup owner to grant you access to the relevant directory.

Steps to Register on the ERDA Homepage:

>   1.  Contact one of the CCRP workgroup owners listed below and agree on which directories
>       you require access to.
>   2.  Go to http://erda.ku.dk/
>   3.  Click on the 'External Users' tab.
>   4.  Click 'Sign up' under "Sign up to ERDA without a KU / UCPH account?"
>   5.  Fill out and submit the form. In the "Optional comment" field, please provide the name
        and email of your UCPH contact (e.g., "Knud Nor Nielsen: knn@plen.ku.dk") and the following information: the CCRP project you are working on, the name of your PI, and the name of the workgroup owner responsible for granting access to directories.
    6.  The workgroup owner should then send an email to knn@plen.ku.dk confirming that you should
        have require access to ERDA.
>   7.  Knud Nor Nielsen will accept your request for access to ERDA and send you an automatic
>       response.
>   8.  Sign in to ERDA to activate your account.
>   9.  The workgroup owner can now grant you access to the relevant CCRP directory.
