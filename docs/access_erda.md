# How to get started with ERDA

### Univeristy of Copenhagen (UCPH) affiliates
ERDA is a data archive set up by the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). All students and employees at UCPH can log in to ERDA and request access to any workgroup. Once you have done this, please contact one of the responsible persons to ensure that your request is not overlooked for too long.

### Non-UCPH collaborators
To get access to ERDA you initially need to register on the ERDA hompage: 
> 	1.	 Go to: http://erda.ku.dk/
> 	2.	click on the tab 'External Users'
> 	3.	Click 'sign up' under "Sign up to ERDA without a KU / UCPH account?"
> 	4. 	Fill out and submit the form.
> 	5.	Contact one of the below listed CCRP workgroup owners, and let the person know which
>           directories you wish to have access to.
