# How to get started with ERDA

### Univeristy of Copenhagen (UCPH) affiliates
ERDA is a data archive set up by the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). All students and employees at UCPH can log in to ERDA and request access to any workgroup. Once you have done this, please contact one of the responsible persons to ensure that your request is not overlooked for too long.

### Non-UCPH collaborators
To get access to one of the CCRP domains on ERDA you first need clearence from one of the workgroup owners listed below. As part of the 'sign up' procedure the workgroup owner will vouch for the candidate by informing the central command (i.e. Knud Nor Nielsen), which workgroup the owner intend to grant the candidate access to and for how long a time periode. The central command will then accept the request sendt through the ERDA 'sign up procedure' (see below), and the candidate will automaticly be informed when this is done. The final two steps are that the candidate needs to sign in to ERDA, in order to activate the account, and the workgroup owner can hereafter grant access to the the workgoup needed.

The steps needed to register on the ERDA hompage: 
> 	1.	Contact one of the below listed CCRP workgroup owners, and agree on which
>           directories you should have access to. 
>   2.  Go to: http://erda.ku.dk/
> 	3.	click on the tab 'External Users'
> 	4.	Click 'sign up' under "Sign up to ERDA without a KU / UCPH account?"
> 	5. 	Fill out and submit the form. In the field `Optional comment`, please refer to your contact
        who is employed at the University of Copenhagen (name + email), e.g: 'Knud Nor Nielsen: knn@plen.ku.dk` and note the CCRP project that you are hired on, the name of your PI, and
        the name of the workgroup owner that will be responsible for granting access to directories.
>   6.  The workgroup owner, now drops as email to knn@plen.ku.dk confirming that this new user
        needs access to ERDA.
    7.  The contacted UCPH emploie (Knud), accepts the request of access to ERDA. This generates an
        automatic response to the new user.
    8.  Now, the new user needs to sign into ERDA to activate the ERDA account.
> 	5.	Finally, the workgroup owner can now grant access to the CCRP directory relevant.
